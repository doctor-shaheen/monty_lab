# Graph Matching

This folder contains a range of notebooks that we used over the past years to test and analyze different aspects of the system. 

NOTE: Many of these notebooks may not run anymore as the code in here is not actively maintained. But they can still be informative on what things we looked into and how we analyzed data. In many cases the code can still be used after updating a few names and imports.
