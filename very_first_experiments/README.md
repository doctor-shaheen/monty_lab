# First Experiments
These are some notebooks with analyses and tests we ran when we first started this project. They take the sensorimotor data collected in Habitat and analyze it, build and extend graphs. This was before the Monty framework was established. We think these notebooks may still be educationally useful if you are trying to understand the data we work with and the whole graph-building process in more depth.
