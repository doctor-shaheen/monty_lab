# Speedup Experiments

We have added several iterations of changes to speed up the current evidenceLM implementations. This folder contains initial tests and profiles we ran to figure out how to make the algorithm more efficient. It also contains some things we looked into that did not turn out to work (like LSH) that we left in here so we can revisit what we have already tried.
